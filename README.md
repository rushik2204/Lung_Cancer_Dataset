# Lung_Cancer_Dataset

This dataset contains information related to various factors that may influence the risk of lung cancer. The data includes demographic information, lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are commonly associated with lung cancer. This dataset can be used to explore correlations, build predictive models, and identify potential risk factors for lung cancer.


# Code Information

In this code I tried to design a classification model using many classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier and XGB Classifier as well.
